			 <p>When should you respond to being misgendered? It&rsquo;s a hard question because it&rsquo;s different each person. There are times, especially when working in customer service, where I simply let it happen. I have been working on my appearance to feminize myself, but there are days I dress very masculine. This isn&rsquo;t the only thing that affects me.</p>
<p>I am also a 6' 4&quot; person which makes people assume I&rsquo;m a man. I chose not to go through voice feminization techniques, so my voice sounds very manly at times. It was a hard decision, but I like my voice. I know I could get less assumptions if I changed it, but I&rsquo;ve chosen to keep my voice.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t always correct people for fear of being attacked or fear of having to endlessly reassure someone as they over-apologize. pro-tip, if you apologize, only do it once. Apologizing way too many times to one incident makes it about you and puts the onus on me to reassure you. That gets tiring after a while.</p>
<p>The best thing any ally can do is to correct in kindness when people misgender a trans person. It takes the pressure off the trans person, as long as they are out, and it shows you care as an ally.</p>
<p>When should I respond? The answer depends on the context. Sometimes it&rsquo;s easier than other times.</p>

			 <p>After many long years, been working on this degree since 2010, I am officially a college graduate. I am quite literally shaking as I can&rsquo;t believe it. It&rsquo;s been many long years of hard work, many tears, many exams and so many long hours of studying. So long classical music that was my guide for many textbooks.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just proof that no matter what, I didn&rsquo;t give up. Took me a long time, but it&rsquo;s not about how long it takes you. It&rsquo;s about achieving that goal you&rsquo;ve had. I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;ll go onto a Master&rsquo;s degree, but <strong>I now have a BA in Communications!!!</strong></p>

I cried as I loaded the final things into my car. I said goodbye to my place. But it&rsquo;s an adventure onto the next thing. My next move will be to move in with my fiance.

<p>Liking the interface improvements so far. You can easily see things like which network interfaces your Pi-hole is using. The temperature gauge was removed which is a shame as I sometimes used the Pi-hole admin to monitor my Pi.</p>
<p>Overall a great update and one that I think helps make Pi-hole easier to use especially for less techy folk. The pi-hole has been one of the best additions to my arsenal after my fiance gifted me my Pi for Christmas. We actually put a Pi in our bead store because it helps stop a lot of bad actors.</p>

			 <p>I‚Äôve got a secret, I have not been loving myself. I have not been giving Jae the true love she needs. I‚Äôve been masking it with others‚Äô reassurance.</p>

<p>How can I let my fiance and family love me if I don‚Äôt love myself? I have done that to them. I have pushed people away. I have attempted subconsciously to push away my best friend and partner. I pushed him to his limit many times because I didn‚Äôt love myself.</p>
<p>I declare that I love Jae Bloom. I love the person I am. I love my flaws. I love my strengths. I love what I‚Äôve done. I love my mistakes for what they‚Äôve taught me. I love my accomplishments.

<p>I do not engage with street preachers. When someone is engaging in that act they aren‚Äôt in a place to hear from me.  I engaged last year for my first Pride and I learned from that experience. Now I just walk on by and let them have their miserable day.</p>
<p>Today while at #Pride, I encountered some street preachers. What I want to say is its amazing how they think the God they serve, which is not the same God I believe in, would ever be OK with them coming to a Pride event to say we are under the call of the devil.</p>
<p>My God comes to people in love. I do not ever proselytise as that turns me off. My God instead wants me to show love to each and every person. To work on myself and become a better me. My God does not think who I love is sinful or that who I am is an abomination.</p>
<p>Ask yourself if your God is the God of love, why are you coming at me with a bullhorn?</p>

			 <p>It‚Äôs one year today that I began the process of having an orchiectomy. It is the first surgery I went through for my gender-affirming care. I completed it in November and am now just paying off massive medical debt over it</p>
<p>One of the things that kept hurting was the amount of people who asked me if I was sure at doing my orchiectomy. The people, my own mom included, who said I was being impulsive at having this surgery.</p>
<p>I have known since I was 4 that I was a trans woman. I have grappled with it all my life. When Caitlyn Jenner made news, I thought I wanted to do that too. I don‚Äôt like her politics, but I admire her doing it despite so much backlash.</p>
<p>I didn‚Äôt begin my journey until 2020. I began hormones and my medical treatments on December 15th, 2020. Fun fact, that is my partner‚Äôs birthday and was just an amazing coincidence once I realised this when we began dating.</p>
<p>It took me a year of hormone replacement therapy, which I had to get approval to begin that, before I was allowed to begin surgery.</p>
<p>A year ago today I finally had my first consultation on my orchiectomy. For those who do not know what that is, I had my testicles removed. I had to wait for a long time to get this consultation booked. I booked it in January of 2022 after I got the referral from my endocrinologist in December of 2021.</p>
<p>I had to wait many long months and I had to do a bunch of thinking about whether I really wanted to do this surgery.</p>
<p>The appointment was incredibly scary and I remember telling my best friend, who is now my partner, that I was so scared. He and I had been talking through the implications of this. At the time we didn‚Äôt realise we would be spending our lives together, he was just someone I was talking to a lot. Like friends do. He talked to me to help make sure I was really ready. He asked good questions, but in a very caring way.</p>
<p>Once I had my consultation I had to undergo some therapy sessions to get a write-off for my insurance. These therapy sessions unfortunately were not covered by insurance and I estimate have cost me between $600-$1,000 out-of-pocket from two therapists. Because insurance didn‚Äôt want just one person. I had to put these on credit cards. Which has added to the debt that I am currently working through.</p>
<p>These sessions were very grueling and asked me a lot of tough questions. The therapists weren‚Äôt pushing me towards the surgery. They were affirming, but they many times asked me if I was ready. Every medical professional along the way was asking me if I was really ready. They all talked me through the implications of this surgery. I never felt pushed into this, if anything I had to prove I was ready.</p>
<p>I remember once the surgery date was set that I was incredibly scared. I was having some major second thoughts. Someone I know sent me a letter saying this was impulsive. I remember sitting with my partner crying and talking through this surgery while I was visiting with him in October.</p>
<p>I met with a friend of a friend who asked me some very difficult questions. He wanted me to make sure I wasn‚Äôt making the wrong decision. Now he wanted me to undergo thousands of hours of therapy (at a cost to me of course due to the healthcare system in this country), but I don‚Äôt think any further therapy would change what I knew. I was literally a week away.</p>
<p>The days and hours up to the surgery I was questioning whether I should do this. I thought long and hard again about this. I know the narrative is people are pushed into these surgeries, but the reality is we have to fight to have them.</p>
<p>Insurance, literally with a day to go, almost hadn‚Äôt approved it yet and I had to fight to call and get them to approve it.</p>
<p>The day of, the doctor talked it through with me again. My partner and I had some heart-to-heart talks that morning. As I was about to put on the anasthesia to fall asleep, I kept thinking of whether I wanted to do this. This was not an impulsive thing.</p>
<p>I woke up from the surgery and felt relieved that it had happened. I have not lost that sense of relief. I didn‚Äôt like the surgery due to the immense pain I was in for a few months following, but it was the right choice for me.</p>
<p>Just please I urge people to not spread the narrative that anyone who elects to undergo gender-affirming surgery surgery is being forced into it. We aren‚Äôt. We aren‚Äôt being impulsive. We‚Äôve had to do a lot of work to get to this point. You might not realise how much we‚Äôve had to do. But please maybe have a bit more empathy for us.</p>

			 <p>From my trans experience sometimes there isn‚Äôt anything you can do to stop people misgendering you. You can dress up how you want and people will still assume your gender.

			 <p>You think I‚Äôm a monster,
You think you know my life,
You make policies to restrict people like me,
You try to remove us from your world.</p>
<p>Maybe the real monster is you.
Maybe you will realise the creativity you‚Äôve lost in your world.
Maybe you will one day realise how much you needed us.</p>
<p>We just want to exist,
We just want to be us.
I didn‚Äôt choose my life,
My life chose me.
Would I have wished for a hard life like this? No.</p>
<p>I may cry myself to sleep,
Just like I am doing tonight as I write this.
I may cry in front of my friends and family,
Just like I did tonight.
But I am happier than you will ever be.
I know who I am.
I seek to lift others up.</p>
<p>You may call me bitter,
You may call me angry,
But you made me bitter and angry.
You made me exhausted.
You made me who I am right now.</p>
<p>I will not let you keep me this way.
My emotions right now will pass,
I will one day not remember how you made me feel in this moment.</p>
<p>I ask you to please think about what your creator would think about what you are doing.
Would your creator be happy that you made me feel this way?
Would your creator be happy with how you‚Äôve have treated one of their creations?
How you used your religion as a holy crusade against the least of these?
How you disrespected a child of God because you think you know your creator‚Äôs ways?</p>
<p>Please think about whether others will know you are a Christian by your love.
Please ask yourself if you are treating me how you would like to be treated?
Are you without sin?
Can you cast the first stone?</p>
<p>I just want to sleep.
I am about to nod off to sleep while crying,
But I ask you to please just respect me.
You don‚Äôt need to understand me.
You don‚Äôt even need to like me.
But I just want to be me,
I just want to be Jae.</p>

			 <p>CW: Religion and discussion of trans journey</p>
<p><strong>Before I get into this post, let me always preface that I do not believe in only one religion or faith. I believe this is a personal journey for each of us. Who am I to discount someone‚Äôs journey? What you read is MY journey, but know I will never try to convert or proselytise anyone. If you want to go on a similar journey to mine, I am more than willing to talk with you. But you have to make the decision that you want a journey like mine. I will say I am always fascinated to hear about other journeys because I love hearing new perspectives. You may in fact help me grow on my own journey by sharing about your own ‚Äúseemingly unrelated‚Äù journey.</strong></p>
<p>A year ago today I was agnostic. I did not know whether God existed or even if he cared about me. Many Christians didn‚Äôt seem to. My own church in 2020 said ‚ÄúI would be more comfortable elsewhere‚Äù. At a time I needed community they weren‚Äôt there for me. I even found out we had someone at church who was forced to be a ‚Äúnon-practicing bisexual‚Äù. How can you not be who you are? I love men (and women) and I love my partner. I cannot cease to be who I am. I tried for years to NOT be who I am.</p>
<p>So I admit I was angry at God and angry at the church. I was upset that in a moment of existential crisis in 2020 when I needed fellowship everyone seemed to push me away. A former youth minister told me that year that to be a Christian I would need to stop sinning and stop being a trans woman. God ‚Äúmade me an amazing man and I need to not say I know better than God‚Äù.</p>
<p>This was a lifelong battle btw. At 4 I knew I was supposed to be a woman. My own family said I couldn‚Äôt challenge God. I took them at their word, but it also set me on a very dangerous mindset of ‚Äúif I can‚Äôt do this, then no one else can either‚Äù. I was in a very binary way of thinking about life. There was right and wrong with no spectrums of morality or ethics. Anyone who didn‚Äôt follow this was bad. This was a very bad way of looking at life. I have spent years learning to undo this mentality.</p>
<p>When I lost my faith, or what I thought was my faith, I began to pursue everything. I did so much research and exploration of faiths and practices. I will say after almost burning down my parents‚Äô house in a burning ritual (do not burn a paper in a tiny coffee mug, bad idea) that I realised who God is to me.</p>
<p>I kept thinking God was angry at me or didn‚Äôt exist. When told by family in 2020 that ‚Äúat least I‚Äôm not gay‚Äù when I announced being trans and at the time thinking I was asexual and aromantic, it hurt. Because deep down I knew I loved someone but I just couldn‚Äôt grasp it. I knew I had this unresolved affection for someone for years. But I was afraid to tell this person because of what my family would think.</p>
<p>What amazed me was seeing how God was there for me the whole time. Even while I yelled at him and used his name in cursing (ps this doesn‚Äôt bother me when others do it, only when I personally do it) he still loved me. He was directing my story. Using this painful moment to perfect aspects of myself that he wanted to change. He had never left me. He just knew I needed some time to think and process. He‚Äôs God after all. He knows me. Why would he be upset if I expressed the emotions he allowed me to have?</p>
<p>To me, God was not the God that my parents or two of my siblings taught me. He is not a Creationist God. I believe he may have used evolution as his method, but he is not as Simple as we make him out to be. He allows free will and does not send us to hell for being gay or bisexual or being a trans woman.</p>
<p>To me, God cares about my character. Am I treating my fellow humans with respect? Am I cheating on my partner unconsensually? Am I lying to my friends? Am I conducting business in an ethical manner? Am I being a good steward of my environment? Am I using my political power to make good voting decisions? Am I fighting for injustices? Am I caring about the poor, the homeless, the refugee? Am I loving others as Christ first loved me?</p>
<p>THAT is what God is concerned about. NOT who I love or my gender identity. He allows that there are abnormalities that allow me to be born in the wrong body. He allows me to love someone even if our ‚Äúplumbing doesn‚Äôt match‚Äù. He loves me and I know that every day. Experiencing true love from a partner has finally helped me understand that authentic romantic love is a small way that God shows us his love.</p>
<p>This Easter, my hope has risen again. I am a Christian and my faith has never been stronger. My faith doesn‚Äôt resemble my upbringing, but it is a firm foundation for me to live my daily life by. This is my journey and faith. It may not be yours, but it is absolutely without a doubt mine. Anyone who says I don‚Äôt know the Bible, ahem, I‚Äôve read the book many, many, many times. Maybe you should read it and explore the meaning of the love of God.</p>

			 <p>I am now almost two weeks out from my orchiectomy as part of my trans affirming healthcare. I‚Äôve had many people asking me why I went ahead with my surgery. Quite a few people were trying to convince me to not to do it. Imploring me that I will regret it.</p>
<p>Let me try and answer some of this.</p>
<p>My testicles have always been a rather, let‚Äôs just say, unpleasant part of my body. Something I wanted to change since I was very young. Seeing my testicles has caused me some major Dysphoria and made me feel ashamed of my body.</p>
<p>During my transition, I have been on a medicine called Spironolactone. This is being used to block the testosterone that my body produces in large quantities thanks to my testicular tissue. Without this medicine, I wouldn‚Äôt be able to see the effects of my estrogen in the same way as I have.</p>
<p>This medicine though has caused my sodium to go low, my potassium to go incredibly high and also caused some issues with my electrolyte levels. I also feel I may have been experiencing brain fog. Ultimately I wanted off this medicine.</p>
<p>There is also a little thing about testicles. They cause your penis to protrude out. Think of the balls as a little pillow that your dick rests on. With them, it is much more likely the penis will protrude. Thus causing some major Dysphoria.</p>
<p>I could‚Äôve held off on doing this surgery until later. This surgery is part one of my bottom surgery, with the next being the turning of the penis into a vagina. I had many people suggest I hold off on doing this until that surgery.</p>
<p>When do I plan to do that surgery? It will be when I move in with my partner, because I don‚Äôt want to be experiencing the immense pain and recovery that surgery will entail without him around. This surgery has been painful enough without him. I stayed at my sister‚Äôs house for a bit. Even returning to work has been extremely painful.</p>
<p>So why did I not put off doing this surgery? Because frankly I wanted to be done with my testosterone production. I wanted off Spironolactone. I will be doing the second part of the surgery anyway, but I could stop my dick from having a hold on my hormones by doing this surgery now. The recovery, which I‚Äôm now two weeks into, will mean that for me I no longer have to be on Spironolactone. There is now no ticking time-clock for me to do surgery to stop this hormone that rages in my body. I am free of Spironolactone and have been free since the morning  of my surgery!</p>
<p>Will I regret this? Regret is such a funny thing. People ask this when it‚Äôs not something they want to do. Think of something you did that was life-changing and made your life better‚Äîthen imagine being asked won‚Äôt you regret it? There is a risk to everything. Life is a dance that has a risk. If we don‚Äôt do things simply because of a chance of regret, we may never end up living the fulfilled life we desire.</p>
<p>I don‚Äôt regret what I did. I regret the pain it put me in, but it‚Äôs temporary. But the fact I am no longer on Spironolactone is amazing. My penis doesn‚Äôt bulge out like it did before. I also have a feeling, I can‚Äôt quite describe it, where I just seem to process things better. I don‚Äôt know how to describe it, but I am happy. Maybe it‚Äôs the effects of having less gender Dysphoria. I don‚Äôt know. But I don‚Äôt regret it.</p>
<p>So why an orchiectomy? Because I wanted to finally live One Jae At A Time and maybe live that Jae just a little bit happier.</p>
