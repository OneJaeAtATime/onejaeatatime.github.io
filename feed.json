Because I wanted to finally live One Jae At A Time and maybe live that Jae just a little bit happier.\n",

That I will never be a woman. That because of my Adam‚Äôs Apple or my broad shoulders that I will never be a woman. Even about what‚Äôs in my pants‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand let me tell you very few have ever seen it. Only those who need to see it either medically or for sex will ever see it. Plus, I‚Äôm choosing one day to remove it so then you won‚Äôt have to worry about what‚Äôs in my pants, because god forbid a woman has a penis.</p>\n<p name=\"091f\" id=\"091f\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">My question to you is WHY do you care to call me a man? Why do you spend your days going after me? <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Don‚Äôt you have better things to do with your life?</strong> Sure, I identified as a man because of the penis that evolution put onto my body. That still doesn‚Äôt make me any less of a woman. I know I‚Äôm a woman because of who I was when I was 4.</p>\n<p name=\"5f58\" id=\"5f58\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">There are people you classify as women based on having a uterus or having breasts, many of them who are men/non-binary/genderfluid/agender, etc. Do you think about the women who are women who you toss aside because they might look more like what you think a man looks like? I‚Äôve seen you claim some people are trans, who are in fact cis women. Being a woman is not based on a specific look or appearance or a part of the body.</p>\n<p name=\"8dba\" id=\"8dba\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I do not know why you continue to insist I‚Äôm a man. I don‚Äôt know what you get from using a phrase that is a factual lie. There are numerous studies about science, unless I‚Äôm going to guess you are anti-science (which knowing some of you who are anti-vaxxers and anti-masker and COVID deniers are probably anti-Science), that show that being trans is normal and valid and something that happens.</p>\n<p name=\"2cc4\" id=\"2cc4\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\">I guess I just want to end by saying ‚ÄúYou are an asshole‚Äù if you continue to call me a man. If you continue to cause me harm by claiming I‚Äôm something that I‚Äôm not. Being an asshole sure doesn‚Äôt sound like fun, but some of you excel at it.</p>\n</div></div>\n",

				"content_text": "<div class=\"section-content\"><div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\">\n<h3 name=\"9ddc\" id=\"9ddc\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf--leading graf--title\">4 Years of Being A Twitch Affiliate</h3>\n<figure name=\"d845\" id=\"d845\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--h3\"><img class=\"graf-image\" data-image-id=\"1*IEDA9N0XHk8yfZr5JInWhg.png\" data-width=\"1600\" data-height=\"900\" src=\"https://onejaeatatime.micro.blog/uploads/2022/d04a473e08.jpg\"></figure><p name=\"fc1a\" id=\"fc1a\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">In January, I will be celebrating 4 years as a Twitch Affiliate. This is a major milestone for me as Twitch has become the most fulfilling thing in my life. It is where I am <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">THE</strong> most alive and myself. I don‚Äôt do it for fame, and I don‚Äôt do it for money. I do it because it‚Äôs the thing in my life that I find satisfaction from. Money DOES help me pay for bills (such as HRT), but it‚Äôs not my primary focus.</p>\n<p name=\"a48c\" id=\"a48c\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I have dreams of being a Twitch Partner, an Ambassador, a member of the Women‚Äôs Alliance, and even being part of an official Twitch Trans group. All are long-term goals of mine. These goals won‚Äôt affect my current love for Twitch but only continue to validate what I‚Äôm already doing. Open up new doors and opportunities for me.</p>\n<p name=\"ce5d\" id=\"ce5d\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I started streaming years ago, actually, though always off and on, back when Justin.tv launched. I had started doing videos in 2006 after having a video of mine make it onto The Screen Savers.</p>\n<figure name=\"285f\" id=\"285f\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf--iframe graf-after--p\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/PeuT1e1MS9o?feature=oembed\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></figure><p name=\"9ebf\" id=\"9ebf\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">I even was invited out to two conferences run by Jeff Pulver, a pioneer in VoIP, who wanted to show that video on the internet was one of the next big things. I even remember being in his audience as he did a full live stream show on BlogTalkRadio back in 2007. He predicted live streaming would be one of the next big avenues‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää-and he was not wrong. Just as he said at a keynote that one day people wouldn‚Äôt call up by a phone number, but by someone‚Äôs name.</p>\n<p name=\"352d\" id=\"352d\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I played around with streaming for years, even streaming quite a few PS4 games on Twitch and getting an Elgato Game Capture to stream PS3 games as well back in 2015. (I gave those consoles to my nephew later, so sadly, no PS3/PS4 streams for the time being.)</p>\n<p name=\"8a02\" id=\"8a02\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">All of my experiences were why I got into the current degree I‚Äôm pursuing in Communications. In 2017 after getting into WoW, I wanted to put my forthcoming degree to use, and I started a podcast with my friends. I loved podcasting (and will be relaunching it in the future once I get more time), but what I REALLY loved was the interaction around doing it live. The shows were fun, but I had so much fun talking with the audience every Thursday evening. So I began again to do game streaming to add more content to what I‚Äôm doing.</p>\n<p name=\"2740\" id=\"2740\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">This continued for a year or two until I decided in October of 2018 to make this a priority in my content production. I was going to work on regularly streaming, so my audience would know when to expect my streams. This started to build a following. I really was enjoying the fact when I was live‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäI wasn‚Äôt feeling lonely. I had begun to find what I really loved to do. Finally putting my video skills to good use.</p>\n<p name=\"56bb\" id=\"56bb\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">So one thing that I wasn‚Äôt realizing was how I started to change and open up. Opening up parts of myself to others, but I would soon find out that I‚Äôd also find myself. I was always working to be authentic, but I‚Äôd try to keep things back to ‚Äúnot offend‚Äù anyone. I very much would keep myself from controversy. Finally, I began to speak up on issues, though slowly. In 2018/2019, my queerplatonic partner Sascz talked about being trans on my podcast. He was very open with me. Then in February of 2020, I brought my other queerplatonic partner Clara on the podcast, and Clara talked about being polyamorous. Two very controversial subjects, but I enjoyed giving a voice to both on my platform.</p>\n<p name=\"12c0\" id=\"12c0\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I had been promoting Dravvie‚Äôs Troll Run for at least two years that supported The Trevor Project. I began to think a lot about my own body and identity while supporting these groups. My story has been said in streams and podcasts, and I‚Äôll expound on it on this blog in the future.</p>\n<p name=\"3d7c\" id=\"3d7c\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">With my audience, I decided to use my platform to be very TRANSparent (SORRY, YOU HAD TO KNOW IT WAS COMING!). Choosing to be representation for someone to explore themselves or to get to understand being trans better. Both have happened many times with individuals coming out or understanding trans individuals better and some even becoming allies for family and friends. I didn‚Äôt want to let my platform‚Äôs opportunity go to waste.</p>\n<p name=\"7bfa\" id=\"7bfa\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Becoming vocal on social issues, coming out, and embracing myself has led to some leaving me. Some saying ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want any sexuality or gender discussions when I‚Äôm watching a stream.‚Äù I was sad and scared at this, but I‚Äôve grown a larger audience. Many of them are straight and/or cisgender, but many are members of the LGBTQIA2U+ and find comfort in my community. This has led people also finally to come out as members as well. If I had to repeat it all over again, I would still come out publicly. I have no regrets now, being over a year later.</p>\n<p name=\"115f\" id=\"115f\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Becoming comfortable on stream as a trans woman has helped me become bolder in my real-life situations. If I can go up against hate (and I‚Äôve gotten lots of hate and continue to get hate), then I can deal with hate in the real world. If you‚Äôve watched my content or validated me, then you have done more good for me being trans than you will ever know.</p>\n<p name=\"fa8a\" id=\"fa8a\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I also was becoming burnt-out on being a creator focused on one game, and I decided to become a variety streamer. This did lead to some people leaving me because I was no longer a creator on their favorite game, but I am now enjoying games again. If I don‚Äôt like a game, I don‚Äôt play it again or wait to replay it. I‚Äôve met many people who tune into all my streams for the community and me. On the other hand, I‚Äôve met people who only tune into certain games‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwhich is 100% valid. I want you here if you want to be here.</p>\n<p name=\"e84c\" id=\"e84c\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">So I‚Äôve taken many risks, made many mistakes, but to quote the song ‚ÄúI did it MYYYYYYYY WAY!!!‚Äù I did it, The Frazley Way. What have I learned?</p>\n<p name=\"9672\" id=\"9672\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">That no one agrees on how to stream, no one has the answers. Every stream is different. If I had the formula for becoming Partner, I‚Äôd do it and tell you how to do it. Unfortunately, there is no such thing as THE game to play (although there ARE more popular games). You‚Äôve got to have fun. I would encourage you to be authentic, to be yourself. I would encourage you to set up chat protections in your stream as well. But most importantly, have fun streaming. When I‚Äôm not having fun, my stream knows it. And I wouldn‚Äôt say I like watching streamers who aren‚Äôt having fun either. That‚Äôs the ONE thing I can say I know from 5 years as a Twitch Affiliate. Do what you are enjoying.</p>\n<p name=\"bf35\" id=\"bf35\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I don‚Äôt know where the next year will take me. I hope that I will be able to begin planning my ‚Äú1 Year as a Twitch Partner‚Äù blog in a year, but I won‚Äôt crunch myself into a timeframe on my goals. So instead, I will continue to do what I‚Äôm doing. Working to make a difference for others. Being a visible Trans Woman on Twitch. Being myself. Being TRANSparent. And‚Ä¶..dying a lot in games. Or accidentally burning down my ship in Sea of Thieves. Or having my Seamoths destroyed in Subnautica. But continuing to be your girl Frazley.</p>\n<p name=\"097e\" id=\"097e\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Be yourself. Be you. And remember that you matter, you are valid, and you are loved.</p>\n<p name=\"6e99\" id=\"6e99\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">EDIT:</em> The title originally said 5 Years of Being a Twitch Affiliate. Being fully transparent, I got the math wrong. I will have finished 4 years of being a Twitch Affiliate, but I‚Äôve been streaming for 5+ years. Damn it Frazley‚Äôs brain. üòÜ I counted and counted many times before making this post. Updated the title to reflect this.</p>\n</div></div>\n",

I always intend to keep things like my old videos, or my old blogs or my old content. Yet, I am starting this all now afresh and anew on a new landscape.</p>\n<p name=\"bded\" id=\"bded\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I think I can be excused for it because of one thing, I this last year threw away my old identity to embrace the identity of Jae Bloom, but you will know me as Frazley Sparkspan online. Many things about this ring true for me, I don‚Äôt remember many of the old memories of who I was. It frankly is hard to think the old stuff was me, because I was living under a mask my whole life.</p>\n<p name=\"87f1\" id=\"87f1\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\">So this is the start of something new. Something fresh. Something that will blossom into something beautiful. I cannot promise to be regular, as I am working 4 jobs and attending school. However, I will promise to ALWAYS be transparent with you. The same transparency I give you on my streams, I give you here. üíú</p>\n</div></div>\n",
